# Academic CV

This repo contains [Geoff Boeing](https://geoffboeing.com/)'s academic CV in LaTeX, permissively licensed for others to adapt if they'd like. It's available to download/preview as a [PDF](https://github.com/gboeing/cv/releases/download/latest/cv-gboeing.pdf).

The CV content and formatting generally conform to Karen Kelsky's [guidelines](https://theprofessorisin.com/) with tweaks for clearer information presentation and better typography.

The CV's tex file is automatically compiled to PDF and released whenever a commit is pushed to the master branch. This keeps the publicly distributed PDF effortlessly up-to-date while avoiding polluting the commit history with frequent changes to a binary file.
