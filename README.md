# Academic CV

This repo contains my academic CV in LaTeX, available to download as a [PDF](https://github.com/gboeing/cv/releases/download/latest/cv-gboeing.pdf).

It generally conforms to Karen Kelsky's [guidelines](https://theprofessorisin.com/), with some tweaks for clearer information presentation and nicer typography.
