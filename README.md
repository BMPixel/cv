This repo contains [Geoff Boeing](https://geoffboeing.com/)'s **LaTeX academic CV**, permissively licensed for others to adapt. The CV content and formatting generally conform to Karen Kelsky's [guidelines](https://theprofessorisin.com/) with tweaks for clearer information presentation and better typography.

The CV's tex file is **automatically compiled** to PDF and released whenever a commit is pushed to the master branch. This keeps the publicly distributed PDF effortlessly up-to-date while avoiding commit history pollution from frequent changes to a binary file.
