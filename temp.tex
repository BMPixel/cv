My name is Wenbo Pan, currently an undergraduate student at the Honor School, Harbin Institute of Technology. I major in Computer Science and Technology. I am expected to receive my Bachelor's degree in July 2024, and I would like to apply to the Centre for Decentralized Trust Computing, CityU, as a Ph.D. candidate under the guidance of Professor Xiaohua Jia in Fall 2024.

My interest lies in researching secure and large-scale model training and deployment in decentralized settings during my doctoral studies. More specifically, I am willing to explore how to optimize the training and deployment of Natural Language Processing applications in federated learning or crowd-sourcing scenarios.

If needed and there's a chance, I'm also willing to applying for a research internship at CDTC in March 2024 to gain practical experience and contribute to ongoing projects.
