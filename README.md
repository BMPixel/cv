# Academic CV

This repo contains my academic CV in LaTeX, available to download as a [PDF](https://github.com/gboeing/cv/releases/download/latest/cv-gboeing.pdf).

The CV content and formatting generally conform to Karen Kelsky's [guidelines](https://theprofessorisin.com/) with tweaks for clearer information presentation and nicer typography.

The CV's tex file is automatically compiled to PDF and released whenever a commit is pushed to the master branch.
